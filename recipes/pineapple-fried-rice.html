    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pineapple fried rice is a delectable and vibrant dish that seamlessly
    fuses sweet and savory flavors with a hint of tropical indulgence. This
    Thai-inspired creation features fluffy grains of cooked rice stir-fried to
    perfection, adorned with an array of colorful vegetables such as bell
    peppers, peas, and carrots. The star of the show, succulent chunks of
    golden pineapple, imparts a delightful natural sweetness that contrasts
    harmoniously with the savory elements. Often enriched with tender pieces of
    cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu, this dish offers a balanced protein
    profile. A medley of seasonings like soy sauce, curry powder, and fragrant
    spices elevate the taste, while garnishes of chopped scallions, toasted
    cashews, and fresh cilantro add both crunch and freshness. With its
    symphony of flavors and visually appealing presentation, pineapple fried
    rice stands as a testament to the culinary magic that can emerge from the
    fusion of diverse ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil or quality vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten with a dash of salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups chopped fresh pineapple</li>
      <li>1 large red bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>¾ cup chopped green onions (about ½ bunch)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped raw, unsalted cashews</li>
      <li>2 cups cooked and chilled brown rice*, preferably long-grain brown
        jasmine rice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 to 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce or sriracha</li>
      <li>1 small lime, halved</li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Handful of fresh cilantro leaves, torn into little pieces, for
        garnishing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a large wok, cast iron skillet or non-stick frying pan over
        medium-high heat and place an empty serving bowl nearby. Once the pan
        is hot enough that a drop of water sizzles on contact, add 1 teaspoon
        oil. Pour in the eggs and cook, stirring frequently, until the eggs are
        scrambled and lightly set, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer the
        eggs to the empty bowl. Wipe out the pan if necessary with a paper
        towel (be careful, it’s hot!).</li>
      <li>Add 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and add the pineapple and red pepper.
        Cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid has evaporated and the
        pineapple is caramelized on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes. Then add
        the green onion and garlic. Cook until fragrant while stirring
        constantly, about 30 seconds. Transfer the contents of the pan to your
        bowl of eggs.</li>
      <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil to
        the pan. Pour in the cashews and cook until fragrant, stirring
        constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the rice to the pan and stir to
        combine. Cook until the rice is hot, stirring occasionally, about 3
        minutes.</li>
      <li>Pour the contents of the bowl back into the pan and stir to combine,
        breaking up the scrambled eggs with your spoon. Cook until the contents
        are warmed through, then remove the pan from heat. Add the tamari and
        chili garlic sauce, to taste. Squeeze the juice of ½ lime over the dish
        and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and set aside.</li>
      <li>Slice the remaining ½ lime into 4 wedges. Transfer the stir-fry to
        individual serving bowls and garnish each bowl with a lime wedge and a
        light sprinkle of cilantro. Serve with bottles of tamari and chili
        garlic sauce or sriracha on the side, for those who might want to add
        more to their bowls.</li>
    </ol>
