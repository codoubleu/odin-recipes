# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes

First project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
This is a basic recipe website consisting of a main index page and links to a
few recipes.

On this project I was able to practice creating basic HTML pages, including the
following things:
- `<a>` for links
- `<img>` for images
- `<ol>` and `<ul>` for ordered and unordered lists
- `<hN>` tags for headers
